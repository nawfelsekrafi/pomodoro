<h3>Pomodoro</h3>
<p>I wanted to be more focused and productive in my work and study specially that developers are long life learners😅 ..</p><p>In addition nowadays companies are competing to steal your attention and time.<p>
<p>Also i have no full web application to show up my skills so I started and coded first the Pomodoro Timer, then the project get bigger and bigger and I added other features like the Ability to save working time, Add, delete and modify projects,  and obviously the ability the create accounts..</p> That is it 😀😊 this is the story behind MY Project POMODORO 😁
I hope it will be useful ..
