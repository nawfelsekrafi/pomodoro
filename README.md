<h3>Pomodoro</h3>
<p>- My story with this project is that I wanted to be more focused and productive in my work and studies because, obviously, developers are life-long learners😅.</p>
<p>The fact that companies are now competing to win your time and attention can be debilitating.</p>
<p> That's why I created a full web application, 
starting with the Pomodoro Timer then the project get bigger and I ended up adding other features such as:</p>
* Keeping record of working time<br>
* Adding, deleting and modifying projects<br>
* Creating a dashboard page<br>
* Managing accounts.</p> That is it 😀😊 this is the story behind MY Project POMODORO 😁
I hope it will be useful ..
